# Plugins to look into:

# Setup
- if you want black to use something other than the default:
Store a black config file as ~/.config/black
this is the actual file, not just a directory
this is the default config from their docs

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py310']
include = '\.pyi?$'
# 'extend-exclude' excludes files or directories in addition to the defaults
extend-exclude = '''
# A regex preceded with ^/ will apply only to files and directories
# in the root of the project.
(
  ^/foo.py    # exclude a file named foo.py in the root of the project
  | .*_pb2.py  # exclude autogenerated Protocol Buffer files anywhere in the project
)
'''
```


- setting `line-length` to an arbritrarily large number is a good way to get most of the benfit without stacking function call arguments toobadly
